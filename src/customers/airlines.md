      <h3>Client Background</h3>
      <p>Dry-leasing is critical part of airlines ability to finance both new and mid-life aircraft, while wet-leasing enables operators to fill capacity gaps.</p>
      <h3>Business Challenge and Problem</h3>
      <p>Leasing is a non-primary business function. With limited internal expertise and resources available, business decisions are made in siloed departments leading to cost leakage and significant end-of-lease financial exposures.</p>
      <p>Everything from Portfolio Management to FP&A becomes cumbersome and manual with reliance on Excel and legacy systems. A “firefighting approach” to repossessions and re-deliveries is widespread, with major lessor running maintenance and lease forecasts on less than 30 aircraft monthly.</p>
      <h3>Differentiated Aerlytix Capabilities</h3>
      <p>From initial RFP to aircraft re-delivery Aerlytix brings the first multilayered SaaS analytics solution custom-built for the aviation industry​. With a centralized database repository for all asset and lease data​, leasing implications are incorporated in all fleet decisions. As an API-centric engine, Aerlytix integrates with M&E systems for automation of all forecasts, and the ability to distill outputs across functions.</p>
      <h3>Business Impacts</h3>
      <p>With a track record of successful implementation, Aerlytix drives immediate value to under resourced fleet teams. With an interconnected infrastructure decision making is simplified with access to all required data, and Aerlytix engine outputs are readily available across functions.</p>
