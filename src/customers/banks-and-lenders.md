      <h3>Client Background</h3>
      <p>Given the capital-intensive nature of the international aviation industry, the financial strength and global reach of large institutional banks and alternative lenders are critical to a healthy industry. Financiers provide a suite of financial products and services for the acquisition, ownership of and investment in aircraft.</p>
      <h3>Business Challenge and Problem</h3>
      <p>The result of such depth of experience, is significant exposure to airlines, MROs, traders, lessors, and within the currently stagnant ABS market. Regardless of that exposure, Banks and Lenders often rely on their debtor counter-parties to monitor and report on metal condition.</p>
      <p>Lenders have been faced with a need to restructure financing arrangements, discounted buyouts, and refinance underwater facilities. Too often left with the ultimate unencumbered asset itself, many lenders have pulled-back or exited the space entirely.</p>
      <h3>Differentiated Aerlytix Capabilities</h3>
      <p>With bank level security, data integrity and audit-ability Financiers have looked to the Aerlytix Analytics Suite to run on-the fly maintenance forecasts through a accessible, easy to understand, and transparent platform. In the tool-tip rich environment Commercial, Technical, and Risk Teams have access to fleet-wide LTV monitoring and full control over assumptions.</p>
      <h3>Business Impacts</h3>
      <p>With best-in-class industry models written in code, the Analytics Suite enables new and returning financiers to accurately assess new business opportunities with precision. For those banks dedicated to the industry, Aerlytix has enabled lenders to efficiently evaluate exposures in the post-pandemic aviation finance landscape.</p>
      <p>The scalable web-based enables financiers to digitize their traditional credit evaluation function through the Aerlytix Risk Module, seamlessly integrated into the rigorous metal context.</p>
