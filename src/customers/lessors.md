      <h4>Client Background</h4>
      <p class="mb-5">With over 51% of the global fleet currently owned by Aircraft Lessors, and a forward looking financing requirement $115bn a year to buy new aircraft Aerlytix clients have looked to the Analytics Suite technology solutions to scale their businesses efficiently.</p>
      <h4>Business Challenge and Problem</h4>
      <p>As lessors approach a three-digit owned or managed fleet size, the shear amount of data, third-party providers, and turbulent nature of aviation generally, leads to significant business  inefficiency.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Everything from Portfolio Management to FP&A becomes cumbersome and manual with reliance on Excel and legacy systems. A “firefighting approach” to repossessions and re-deliveries is widespread, with major lessor running maintenance and lease forecasts on less than 30 aircraft monthly.</p>
      <h4>Differentiated Aerlytix Capabilities</h4>
      <p class="mb-5">Purpose built to Aviation Finance, Aerlytix connects an otherwise desperate industry all within a centralized web-based infrastructure. Through the integration of both external data sources internal asset management systems into the Aerlytix API engine, customers benefit from the systems proven ability to forecast fleets of +600 aircraft in seconds with the most up-to-date data available.</p>
      <h4>Business Impacts</h4>
      <p>With a 75% reduction in the FTE hours required to run a monthly maintenance and lease forecasting process major lessors benefit from decision making with the most current data.</p>
      <p>As a centralized strategic infrastructure outputs from the Aerlytix analytics suite benefit all functions through enhanced Portfolio Management, FP&A reporting, technical, compliance, and audit.</p>
