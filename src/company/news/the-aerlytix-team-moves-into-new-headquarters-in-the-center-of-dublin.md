**Dublin, Ireland – April 2022:** Aerlytix, the aviation industry technology solutions company, has opened its new office at Upper Mount Street in Dublin, Ireland.

As one of the fastest growing aviation technology companies in Ireland, Aerlytix now has room to continue its rapid growth trajectory. After a long time working from home, the Aerlytix team are delighted to be working under the same roof as the company continues to expand.

> Having spent most of the last few years working from home, it is great to have the buzz of an office environment available to the team again. Having the team sitting together in a central location, is great for collaboration and energy levels.
